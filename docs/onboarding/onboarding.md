This part of the document will provide you with all the necessary information to
get access to the lab space, communication within the lab, and other firsts as 
you get settled in. 

{: .warning}
There may be a lot of new information - if you are feeling overwhelmed, don't 
hesitate to ask around the lab for help! 

## Notebook
Physical lab notebooks are available, but the recommendation is to use an online
alternative as this makes it easy to share with others as necessary. You are 
free to use whichever you are most comfortable with. Possible solutions include:

* Google docs
* Notion
* OneNote
* Evernote

Some recommendations include:
* Keeping one notebook to document discussions during 
one-on-one or small group meetings with your mentors / supervisors - it is 
most useful to share this document prior to any meeting as a refresher
* One notebook for day-to-day notes
* One notebook for high-level goals and milestones
