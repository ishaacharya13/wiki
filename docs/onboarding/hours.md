## Working Hours
In-person interactions tend to be beneficial to learning and progressing 
science. With most meetings occuring during the day and the relatively common 
occurence of informal discussions, it is encouraged to be working in the lab 
during the core hours of the day unless you are feeling unwell or have discussed 
prior arrangements. It is also a great way to get to know the people you will be
working with.

For work-study program students, you will need to log your hours using a 
provided timesheet. Each week, you will need to send your signed timesheet to
[Rebecca Nash]. This can be done via e-mail if Adobe Reader is used to provide 
digital signatures. Otherwise, these can be printed and signed.

 

## Mental Health & Wellbeing 
Your mental health and wellbeing is important! It is encourged to take days off 
as personal time can be beneficial to your wellness! Graduate students are 
entitled to at least 2 weeks of vacation time per year.

If you need someone to talk to, my door is always open. Additionally, Western 
provides professional and confidential services, free of charge via 
[Health & Wellness Services].
