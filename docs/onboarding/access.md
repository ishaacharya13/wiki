Our lab is located in a secure, card-access building. Additionally, our lab is
behind a door that requires a key to unlock.

## Card Access
Your Western card should grant you access into the outer doors of Robarts. If 
you are unable to enter one of the secured doors using your card, you will need
to contact Rebecca Nash (cc: Ali) with the following information:

* Name of person needing access
* Their employment relationship (Staff, Grad Student, Associated Persons)
* Email address of person needing access
* UWO ID # for person needing access (if available)
* Dates required for access (Start/End)
* Reason for access

{: .note}
If you forget your card at home or left it at your desk, you can also enter 
through the front doors (on the 2nd floor where security is located)

## Keys
There are two doors, both using the same key, that can be used to enter the lab: 
* By the atrium
* Through the halls by the men's washroom 

To request a key to the lab (RRI 1240), follow the steps 
[here](https://www.uwo.ca/fm/client_services/keys.html).

During the day, this door is likely to be unlocked. In the evening or if you are
the first to arrive, you may find this door locked.
