## Slack
Slack is a team messaging platform and the preferred method of online 
communication (rather than e-mail), for both collaborative and individual 
messaging. We use paid version of slack, meaning all of the messages and files
posted are archived indefinitely, making it easy to refer back. Apps exist for 
Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and even through the web browser. Our team
can be found on [khanlab.slack.com](https://khanlab.slack.com). If you are not 
yet on slack, ask the administrator ([Dr. Khan]) for an invite.

## Mailing Lists
While we prefer to use Slack, there are still some useful mailing lists that
you may want to join to get information on the latest seminar, guest speaker, 
etc. You can find a list below:

<!-- Check if this link is still valid -->
* Robarts Mailing Lists (opt-in 
[here](http://mailman.robarts.ca/mailman/listinfo))
    * CFMM_users
    * Imaging


## Zoom
Many meetings that occur are either hybrid or virtual. Within the lab, and in 
many external events, these meetings are hosted via the Zoom video 
communications platform. As a Western student, you have access to the paid
version of Zoom free of charge (e.g. essentially no-limit on meeting length).
Visit the [Western Zoom page](https://westernuniversity.zoom.us) for more 
information and to download the Zoom client.
